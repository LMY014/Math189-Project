    "## Relevancy & Inspiration\n",
    "\n",
    "The relevance of this problem lies in the persistent and growing nature of car accidents, which continue to pose significant risks to public safety worldwide. With an increasing number of variables influencing these incidents, understanding the root causes of fatal accidents is crucial to mitigating their impact. With the increasing population of drivers, it is essential to prioritize the education of safe driving practices. The most effective way to achieve this is by identifying the key elements that contribute to these dangerous, often fatal, crashes. Research indicates that nearly 77% of Americans have been involved in a motor vehicle accident, highlighting the need to mitigate injury severity. By analyzing these factors, we aim to provide insights that support safer driving practices and policy improvements."

    "The dataset used in this study is a consolidated database of police-reported motor vehicle traffic accidents in the United States, compiled for actuarial applications. The data originates from the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and includes records from two key public sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Crash Report Sampling System (CRSS) – A nationally representative sample of approximately 50,000 police-reported motor vehicle traffic accidents (MVTAs) per year since 2016, replacing the earlier General Estimates System (GES) (2001–2015).\n",
    "2. Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) – A national census of all MVTAs that result in a fatality within 30 days of the event.\n",
    "The dataset includes a nationally representative sample of 1,583,520 individuals involved in 20 years (2001–2020) of fatal and non-fatal crashes. Data has been filtered, standardized, and pooled to ensure consistency across different sources, enabling robust analysis of injury severity, insurance risk factors, and accident trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is designed to be a nationally representative sample of motor vehicle traffic accidents in the United States. It combines data from the Crash Report Sampling System (CRSS), which is a weighted sample of non-fatal crashes, and the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS), a complete census of fatal crashes. To ensure representativeness, a pooling methodology is applied, where fatal accidents in CRSS are replaced with FARS data while maintaining proper weighting. However, some discrepancies exist due to changes in data collection methodologies between GES (2001–2015) and CRSS (2016–2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is structured to track crashes at multiple levels of detail:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ST_CASE: A unique identifier assigned to each crash.\n",
    "* VEH_NO: Identifies vehicles involved in a crash, allowing differentiation of multiple vehicles within the same accident.\n",
    "* PER_NO: Identifies individuals within each vehicle, including drivers and passengers.\n",
    "This hierarchical organization enables analysis at the accident level (ST_CASE), vehicle level (VEH_NO), and individual level (PER_NO), facilitating studies on crash severity, vehicle characteristics, and personal factors affecting injury outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset was compiled and analyzed by Carlos Andrés Araiza Iturria, Mary Hardy, and Paul Marriott from the University of Waterloo, Canada. Their research methodology, data processing techniques, and analysis are documented in their paper, which provides a framework for integrating and utilizing this dataset for insurance and actuarial research​."

    "Our chi-square analysis of factors related to car accident outcomes revealed that all examined variables - age, accident year, and number of vehicle occupants - have statistically significant associations with both injury severity and vehicle deformation levels (all p-values < 0.001). However, the strength of these associations, as measured by Cramer's V coefficients, is relatively weak (all values < 0.1), suggesting 'negligible associations' according to standard interpretation guidelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of occupants in the vehicle showed the strongest association with injury severity (V = 0.0830), followed by age (V = 0.0745). The association between accident year and injury outcomes was notably weaker (V = 0.0315). For vehicle deformation, all factors showed similarly weak associations (V values between 0.05-0.07).\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings demonstrate that while these demographic and situational factors have statistically significant relationships with accident outcomes, their predictive power is limited when considered individually. This pattern is common in large datasets where even small effects become statistically significant. To develop more meaningful predictive models for accident outcomes, we recommend incorporating additional variables such as gender, substance use, vehicle type, and specific accident mechanisms."

    "   - Vehicles with more occupants (4+) show progressively higher rates of severe deformation\n",

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "While all examined relationships are statistically significant, their practical significance is limited due to low Cramer's V values. The number of vehicle occupants shows the strongest association with injury outcomes (V = 0.0830), suggesting it may be a more meaningful predictor than age or accident year. The data also reveals potentially important patterns, such as the elderly being at higher risk for fatal injuries and more recent years showing improved vehicle safety outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings suggest that while demographic and temporal factors have some influence on accident outcomes, they alone cannot strongly predict injury severity or vehicle damage. A more comprehensive predictive model would need to incorporate additional factors such as collision type, vehicle characteristics, road conditions, and driver behavior."
